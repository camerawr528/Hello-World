# Hello-World

Hello everyone. 

I am an interested and curious professional in the biotech industry who wants to take on 
a new hobby in coding and potentially being able to apply it towards my career. I am currently
learning python and javascript on various apps, but I hope that I can learn even better on here. 
As hobbies, I like to eat and try different restaurants as well as rock climb from time to time. 
I also hope to start traveling on my own someday. Cheers.
